# Roll Dice App

The Roll Dice App is a simple, fun application built using Flutter, designed to simulate the roll of a dice. The app features an interactive user interface with smooth animations to enhance the user's experience. With just a tap, users can "roll" a virtual dice, generating a random number from 1 to 6, just like a physical dice.

Key Features:

Simple UI: Clean and intuitive interface that makes the app easy to use for all ages.
Randomized Rolls: Each roll produces a random number, providing a realistic dice experience.
Smooth Animations: Rolling animations give the app a dynamic feel.
Sound Effects (Optional): Add sound effects to enhance the experience with an audible dice roll.
This app is ideal for anyone needing a quick dice roll for games, decision-making, or just for fun.
